# CircleGame
A game with circles. Move around and run into circles smaller than you to grow, and avoid AI circles larger than you.

This demo features the player character and a single circle spawner, which spawns non-AI objects meant for any AI or the player to consume.
There are also 4 AI circles in each corner of the map, which will attempt to consume other circles (including the player) in order to grow themselves.

At this point, the AI will attempt to avoid other circles that are larger than it, but it is still not very smart. That being said, the AI should still offer a bit of a challenge to the player.

# Controls
WASD or Arrow Keys to move.
